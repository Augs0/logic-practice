# Logic Practice ðŸ¥‘ ðŸ¦•

This repo is to store various tasks I attempt to improve my logic skills.

If you wish to use it to look at any of the tasks yourself,

1. fork and clone this repo
2. run `npm i` to install any dependencies
3. run `npm test` in any part of the project to run all test suites or `npm test` followed by a keyword to limit the suites that run e.g. `npm test sort`
