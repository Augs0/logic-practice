This one made sense to me as I could visualize the situation. Once you move beyond one till for a bunch of customers or one till per customers, you just need to figure out when people will be finished and which till takes the longest to server everyone. I'd love to know if there's a way to avoid the double `for loop` in the final `else` though.
